# 🧠 Learnathon 01 – fast.ai Sprint

**Date**: April 4 – April 7, 2025  
**Location**: Network School (Terminus)  
**Curator**: Leonardo aka @leomanfree  
**Format**: 3-day Learn Sprint on fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning

---

## 🌄 Overview

This was the **first permissionless Learnathon** hosted inside Network School.

We focused on **Lesson 1** and part of **Lesson 2** from [fast.ai’s course](https://course.fast.ai/), and framed the sprint around autonomy, friction, and XP-based progression.

Rather than watching videos passively, learners were invited to:

- Run the full notebook on Google Colab
- Rebuild key model components from scratch
- Reflect in public via Twitter threads
- Log their progress in personal Notion pages

## 🧭 Key Lessons

- XP-based learning works — but **requires real tracking**.  
- Friction is the gateway to real understanding.  
- Sovereign learners need both tools *and* structure.  
- Protocol > curriculum.

## 🚧 Known Issues

- No consistent XP tracker was implemented during this sprint  
- Peer-to-peer support was informal and not logged  
- XP system v2 is being developed for future Learnathons

---

## 📌 Notes for future runs

- Build in XP tracking from Day 0 (Notion or GitHub forms)  
- Design micro-quests with clear deliverables and rewards  
- Use peer review to anchor community feedback  
- Integrate media sharing into the learning flow
