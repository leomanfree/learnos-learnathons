# 🧠 Learnathon 02 — XP Quests (ZK Cryptography Sprint)

This questboard was designed to guide sovereign learners through modular learning stages based on Dan Boneh’s *Cryptography I* course and Porter Adams' ZK101.

## 🧭 Quest Levels

Each quest tier is tied to XP progress and autonomy.

### 🟢 Beginner – Awareness & Conceptual Entry

- Join a peer discussion OR share 3 takeaways publicly  
- Attempt a mini-explainer: “Why ZK matters for coordination” (text, voice, or video)  
- Claim your XP → `Explorer-2`

### 🔴 Builder – Synthesis & Signal
- Complete Boneh Modules 4–5  
- Draft a zk use case or smart contract snippet (e.g. Circom, Noir, or pseudocode)  
- Peer-review another participant’s work  
- Optional: submit to GitHub for archive recognition
