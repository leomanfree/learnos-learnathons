## 🌌 Teaser

The next Learnathon has begun.

This time, we’re diving into the world of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**, foundational cryptography, and the emerging architecture of **Learn-to-Earn** systems.

With the guidance of [**Porter Adams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/porter-adams-0127b7125/), teacher of the largest ZK course ever built — and drawing on the legendary *Cryptography I* course by **Dan Boneh** — this Learnathon will unlock:

- 🧠 A deeper understanding of how cryptography powers digital coordination  
- 🎯 Modular XP Quests — from theory to zk circuits  
- 🧪 Peer-reviewed challenges, explainers, and real-world outputs  
- 🔁 From sovereign learning → to sovereign credentials
