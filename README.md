# 📚 LearnOS – Open Archive

Welcome to the **LearnOS Open Archive** — a permissionless, open-source knowledge base designed for sovereign learners, memetic builders, and coordination hackers.

Born inside the **Network School**, this archive is a record of the earliest Learnathons, XP systems, and Media Protocols created by the community. It is not a finished product — it is a living, breathing experiment.

## 🌱 What’s inside

- 📘 **Learnathons** — full archives of permissionless sprints like Fast.ai and the ZK Learnathon.
- 🎮 **XP Quests** — modular activities structured by topic and difficulty, inspired by RPGs and skill trees.
- 🧰 **Toolkit** — Notion templates, XP trackers, peer review flows, and more.
- 🎙️ **Media Protocol** — how to turn learning into narrative, propagation, and sovereign culture.

## 📐 Core Principles

- **Learn-to-Earn**, not Learn-to-Pass.
- **XP > quizzes** — proof of learn is proof of action.
- **Open-source first** — permissionless contribution and remixing.
- **Learning is Coordination** — and coordination is a superpower.
- **Memetic Propagation** — education is storytelling, with stakes.

## 🤝 Contribute

This archive is meant to be forked, remixed, and extended.  
See [`contribute.md`](./contribute.md) for guidelines on how to:

- Add your own Learnathon
- Create new XP Quests
- Submit tools or frameworks
- Propose improvements to the LearnOS

## ⚡ TL;DR

> “Don’t build schools. Build protocols.”  
> — You, reading this README.
