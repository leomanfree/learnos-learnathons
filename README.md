# 📚 LearnOS – Open Archive

Welcome to the LearnOS Open Archive —  
a permissionless, open-source knowledge base  
for sovereign learners, memetic builders, and coordination hackers.

Born inside the Network School, LearnOS documents and powers:

- The first sovereign Learnathons (FastAI, Cryptography & ZK)
- The modular XP system for proof-of-learn
- Coordination rituals and media propagation protocols

This is not a finished product.  
It is a living protocol in continuous ignition.

## 🌱 What’s Inside

- 📘 **Learnathons** — full archives of FastAI + Cryptography Sprints
- 🎮 **XP Quests** — modular RPG-style challenges with XP tiers
- 🧰 **Toolkit** — Notion templates, trackers, forms, media layers
- 🧪 **Coordination Infrastructure** — Learn-to-Earn logic, rituals, and signal flows
- 🎙️ **Media Protocol** — turn learning into narrative and cultural propagation

---

## 📐 Core Principles

- **Learn-to-Earn**, not Learn-to-Pass  
- **XP > quizzes** — proof-of-learn is proof-of-action  
- **Open-source first** — permissionless contribution, remix, and iteration  
- **Learning = Coordination** — and coordination is a superpower  
- **Memetic Propagation** — education is storytelling with consequences

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- 🧠 **Hackathon:** Build the first Learn-to-Earn primitives (XP minting, SBTs, ZK credentials)
- 🧪 **Learnathon 3:** A real-world peer-to-peer testbed (discovery x contribution)
- 🛰️ **Network Layer:** Explore L2 integrations (e.g. zkSync, Arbitrum, Optimism)
