# 📚 LearnOS – Open Archive

Welcome to the **LearnOS Open Archive** — a permissionless, open-source knowledge base  
designed for sovereign learners, memetic builders, and coordination hackers.

Born inside the **Network School**, this archive documents the earliest Learnathons,  
XP systems, and Media Protocols created by the community.

It is not a finished product — it is a living, breathing experiment.

## 📐 Core Principles

- **Learn-to-Earn**, not Learn-to-Pass  
- **XP > quizzes** — proof of learn is proof of action  
- **Open-source first** — permissionless contribution and remixing  
- **Learning is Coordination** — and coordination is a superpower  
- **Memetic Propagation** — education is storytelling, with stakes
